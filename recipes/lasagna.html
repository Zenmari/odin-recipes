<h1>Lasagna</h1>
<p>This is a lasagna recipe made with lasagna-based ingredients and lasagna-based methods of making lasagna. Even though this is just a practice page for The Odin Project's course, I don't want to totally plagiarize the family recipe Craig laid out. Instead, I'll list a series of lasagna-centric information about lasagna (e.g. how lasagna tastes like lasagna). In order to create lasagna, you'll likely need:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
    <li>Pasta</li>
    <li>Lasagna <em>(you know; to add more lasagna on top of your lasagna)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, you may be asking yourself, "What am I going to do with all this? How do I turn it into some delicious homemade lasagna?" Well, to turn it into lasagna, all you have to do is:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Throw it into a bowl</li>
    <li>Fill the bowl with water</li>
    <li>Go down to your local store and buy some goldfish</li>
    <li>Gently drop your goldfish into an aquarium <em>(note: it doesn't have to be your aquarium)</em></li>
    <li>Be nice to your goldfish. Take care of them for a few weeks, treat them with love and care</li>
    <li>After a few weeks, you can return to your runny homunculi of tomato sauce, pasta, lasagna, and tap water, and throw it out the window</li>
    <li>Simply go to your nearest Italian restaurant and buy some lasagna</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>It's as easy as that!</strong></p>
