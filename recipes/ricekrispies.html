<h1>Rice Krispies</h1>
<p>For eons, mankind has pondered how to eat rice, but also, how to make it crispy. It wasn't until 1928 that man would receive its answer through the elven diplomats known as "Snap", "Crackle", and "Pop." They taught man that there was no way to make rice crispy; <em><strong>however,</strong></em> there was a way to make rice krispie. As we understand it now, the "k" makes all the difference. Following tradition, in order to make rice krispies, you will need:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Rice</li>
    <li>Krispies</li>
</ul>
<p>Though rice is often found in healthy supply, it can be considerably more difficult to find a source of krispies. For this, I have no advice to offer <em>(that is to say, if I did share where I obtain my krispies, there would surely be no krispies left for either of us to obtain).</em> However, should you find a source of krispies, in order to make rice krispies, all you must do is:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Bop it</li>
    <li>Twist it</li>
    <li>Pull it</li>
</ol>
<p><em>That is all.</em></p>
